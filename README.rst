Deep Cascade of Convolutional Neural Networks for MR Image Reconstruction
=========================================================================

Reconstruct MR images from its undersampled measurements using Deep Cascade of
Convolutional Neural Networks (DC-CNN). This repository contains the
implementation of DC-CNN using Theano and Lasagne and the simple demo. Note that
the library requires the dev version of Lasagne and Theano, as well as pygpu
backend for using CUFFT Library. Some of the toy dataset borrowed from
<http://mridata.org>.

1. 2D Reconstruction
====================

Usage::

  python main_2d.py --num_epoch 5 --batch_size 2 


----


2. Dynamic Reconstruction
=========================================================================

Reconstruct dynamic MR images from its undersampled measurements using DC-CNN
with Data Sharing layer. Note that the library requires CUDNN in addition to the
requirement specified above.

Usage::

  python main_3d.py --acceleration_factor 4
